I am an educator, researcher, data scientist, and writer. I am currently the Associate Director of Early Childhood Program Performance at the Virginia Department of Education, where I work to expand access to and improve the quality of early childhood education programs across the state of Virginia. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, data visualization/modeling, going to the gym, and spending time with friends & family (including my pup, Nala).

I earned my PhD in educational psychology from the [VCU School of Education](https://soe.vcu.edu/) in July 2019, where worked in the [Motivation and Self-Regulation Lab](http://wp.vcu.edu/skzumbrunn/) and in the [Cognition and Learning Lab](https://rampages.us/coglearnlab/) to study students' motivation, behaviors, and achievement. In my [dissertation](https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/5977/), I studied how writers' daily emotional states (think: anxiety, enjoyment, boredom) influenced their productivity as well as the day-to-day inertia of these emotional states.


I typically use `R` to wrangle (e.g. `{tidyverse}`), model (e.g. `{tidymodels}`, `{lme4}`, `{lavaan}`), and visualize (e.g. `{ggplot2}`, `{shiny}`) data, and I am deeply interested in how to effectively translate insights from data into practice.
