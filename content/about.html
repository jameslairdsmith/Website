<p>I am an educator, researcher, data scientist, and writer. I am currently the Associate Director of Early Childhood Program Performance at the Virginia Department of Education, where I work to expand access to and improve the quality of early childhood education programs across the state of Virginia. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, data visualization/analysis, going to the gym, and spending time with friends &amp; family (including my pup, Nala).</p>

<p>I earned my PhD in educational psychology from the <a href="https://soe.vcu.edu/">VCU School of Education</a> in July 2019, where I worked in the <a href="http://wp.vcu.edu/skzumbrunn/">Motivation and Self-Regulation Lab</a> and in the <a href="https://rampages.us/coglearnlab/">Cognition and Learning Lab</a> to study students’ motivation, behaviors, and achievement. In my <a href="https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/5977/">dissertation</a>, I studied how writers’ daily emotional states (think: anxiety, enjoyment, boredom) influenced their productivity as well as the day-to-day inertia of these emotional states.</p>
<p>During grad school, I discovered a love for working with data – exploring, visualizing, modeling, and communicating. I mostly work in <code>R</code>, and am proficient in the usual packages that folks use for data analysis, visualization, and modeling (e.g. the <code>{tidyverse}</code> and <code>{tidymodels}</code> suites), plus some more specialized packages. I really enjoy discovering new <code>R</code> packages and learning new things that <code>R</code> can do. I’m (very slowly) learning to code in <code>python</code> – there’s not much free time with an infant in the house – and hope to find time to pick up <code>Julia</code> and <code>D3.js</code> as well.</p>
