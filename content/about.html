<p>I am an educator, researcher, data scientist, and writer. I am currently the Associate Director of Early Childhood Program Performance at the Virginia Department of Education, where I work to expand access to and improve the quality of early childhood education programs across the state of Virginia. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, data visualization/modeling, going to the gym, and spending time with friends &amp; family (including my pup, Nala).</p>

<p>I earned my PhD in educational psychology from the <a href="https://soe.vcu.edu/">VCU School of Education</a> in July 2019, where worked in the <a href="http://wp.vcu.edu/skzumbrunn/">Motivation and Self-Regulation Lab</a> and in the <a href="https://rampages.us/coglearnlab/">Cognition and Learning Lab</a> to study students’ motivation, behaviors, and achievement. In my <a href="https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/5977/">dissertation</a>, I studied how writers’ daily emotional states (think: anxiety, enjoyment, boredom) influenced their productivity as well as the day-to-day inertia of these emotional states.</p>
<p>I typically use <code>R</code> to wrangle (e.g. <code>{tidyverse}</code>), model (e.g. <code>{tidymodels}</code>, <code>{lme4}</code>, <code>{lavaan}</code>), and visualize (e.g. <code>{ggplot2}</code>, <code>{shiny}</code>) data, and I am deeply interested in how to effectively translate insights from data into practice.</p>
