This page presents a collection of data visualizations I've created, mostly for fun/in my free time. All visualizations were created using the R programming language.

Using data from [Richmond's Open Data Portal](https://data.richmondgov.com/Unique-and-Inclusive-Neighborhoods/Pet-Licenses/fgv9-bhf4) and [Open Street Map](https://cran.r-project.org/package=osmdata), I mapped the location of cats and dogs in RVA.

I mined transcripts from the [YMH Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYIgiXwJck_Pb5Nj-wIrsqg) to look at definitive words -- those that are unique to a group of episodes -- over the last ~150 episodes.

## Beach Volleyball

Using data from the [#TidyTuesday Project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md) (via [BigTime stats](https://bigtimestats.blog/data/)), I visualized Kerri Walsh Jennings and Misty May-Treanor's key match statistics over time.

## Beer Production

[![](https://github.com/ekholme/TidyTuesday/blob/master/2020%20-%2014%20-%20beer%20production/beer_maps.jpg?raw=true)](https://github.com/ekholme/TidyTuesday/blob/master/2020%20-%2014%20-%20beer%20production/beer_maps.jpg?raw=true)

Using data from the [Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau](https://www.ttb.gov/beer/statistics), I created a cartogram showing which states produce the most beer relative to their populations.

## White Christmas Lyrics

[![](https://github.com/ekholme/TidyTuesday/blob/master/52%20-%20christmas%20songs/cosby_network.jpeg?raw=true)](https://github.com/ekholme/TidyTuesday/blob/master/52%20-%20christmas%20songs/cosby_network.jpeg?raw=true)

After pulling lyrics using the [`{genius}`](https://github.com/josiahparry/genius) package, I created a network to show connections between words used in the album.

I used data from the [Virginia Quality](https://www.virginiaquality.com/) website and [Google's GeoCoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) to create a Voronoi tesselation of high-quality ECCE sites in Virginia.

## 21st Century Rap Rankings

[![](https://github.com/ekholme/TidyTuesday/blob/master/2020%20-%2016%20-%20rap%20artists/rap_bars.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/ekholme/TidyTuesday/blob/master/2020%20-%2016%20-%20rap%20artists/rap_bars.png?raw=true)

Using data from a [BBC Music](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20191007-the-greatest-hip-hop-songs-of-all-time-who-voted) survey on the best hip-hop songs of all time, I analyzed who the most celebrated rappers were each year in the 21st century.
