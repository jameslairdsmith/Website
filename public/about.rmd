I am an educator, researcher, data scientist, and writer. I am currently the Associate Director of Early Childhood Program Performance at the Virginia Department of Education, where I work to expand access to and improve the quality of early childhood education programs across the state of Virginia. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, data visualization/analysis, going to the gym, and spending time with friends & family (including my pup, Nala).

I earned my PhD in educational psychology from the [VCU School of Education](https://soe.vcu.edu/) in July 2019, where I worked in the [Motivation and Self-Regulation Lab](http://wp.vcu.edu/skzumbrunn/) and in the [Cognition and Learning Lab](https://rampages.us/coglearnlab/) to study students' motivation, behaviors, and achievement. In my [dissertation](https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/5977/), I studied how writers' daily emotional states (think: anxiety, enjoyment, boredom) influenced their productivity as well as the day-to-day inertia of these emotional states.

During grad school, I discovered a love for working with data -- exploring, visualizing, modeling, and communicating. I mostly work in `R`, and am proficient in the usual packages that folks use for data analysis, visualization, and modeling (e.g. the `{tidyverse}` and `{tidymodels}` suites), plus some more specialized packages. I really enjoy discovering new `R` packages and learning new things that `R` can do. I'm (very slowly) learning to code in `python` -- there's not much free time with an infant in the house -- and hope to find time to pick up `Julia` and `D3.js` as well.
