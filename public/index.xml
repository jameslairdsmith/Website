      <description>I am an educator, researcher, data scientist, and writer. I am currently the Associate Director of Early Childhood Program Performance at the Virginia Department of Education, where I work to expand access to and improve the quality of early childhood education programs across the state of Virginia. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, data visualization/modeling, going to the gym, and spending time with friends &amp;amp; family (including my pup, Nala).</description>
