      <description>I started working in the Virginia Department of Education’s Office of Early Childhood about 10 months ago, and since then, I’ve learned a ton about the early childhood landscape across the commonwealth – how many different programs there are that provide supports for early childhood, who qualifies for these programs, how publicly-funded programs intersect and interact with private (read: paid for by families) programs, how families learn about and enroll their children in early childhood care and education (ECCE).</description>

      <description>The point of this post is to explore some of the packages and capabilities of the {tidymodels} universe of packages, including:
rsamplerecipesdialsparsniptuneyardstickTogether, these packages can help streamline the modeling process. The point of this post is not to try to build the best model(s) possible for the given data, and I’m skipping over a bunch of the exploration I would normally do before modeling to get right into the modeling steps.</description>

      <description>I think I first discovered Tool in middle school, when I borrowed my dad’s CDs to listen to on the bus ride to school. This was right when Lateralus came out, and I remember listening to “Schism” over and over and over, staring out of the dingy bus window every morning. Ever since then, I’ve been a huge fan – not just of Tool, but also of Maynard James Keenan’s other bands: A Perfect Circle and Puscifer.</description>

      <description>This page presents a collection of data visualizations I’ve created, mostly for fun/in my free time. All visualizations were created using the R programming language.
#TidyTuesday Visuals#TidyTuesday is a weekly data analysis and visualization project run by the [R4DS Online Learning Community] intended to provide R users with opportunities to refine their skills. The visuals below are my contributions #TidyTuesday. Code for all visuals is in my Github.</description>
