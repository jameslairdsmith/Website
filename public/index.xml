      <description>I am an educator, researcher, data scientist, and writer. I am currently the Associate Director of Early Childhood Program Performance at the Virginia Department of Education, where I work to expand access to and improve the quality of early childhood education programs across the state of Virginia. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, data visualization/modeling, going to the gym, and spending time with friends &amp;amp; family (including my pup, Nala).</description>

      <description>This page presents a collection of data visualizations I’ve created, mostly for fun/in my free time. All visualizations were created using the R programming language.
#TidyTuesday Visuals#TidyTuesday is a weekly data analysis and visualization project run by the [R4DS Online Learning Community] intended to provide R users with opportunities to refine their skills. The visuals below are my contributions #TidyTuesday. Code for all plots is in my Github.</description>
