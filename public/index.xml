      <description>I am an educator, researcher, data scientist, and writer. I am currently the Associate Director of Early Childhood Program Performance at the Virginia Department of Education, where I work to expand access to and improve the quality of early childhood education programs across the state of Virginia. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, data visualization/modeling, going to the gym, and spending time with friends &amp;amp; family (including my pup, Nala).</description>

      <description>I think I first discovered Tool in middle school, when I borrowed my dad’s CDs to listen to on the bus ride to school. This was right when Lateralus came out, and I remember listening to “Schism” over and over and over, staring out of the dingy bus window every morning. Ever since then, I’ve been a huge fan – not just of Tool, but also of Maynard James Keenan’s other bands: A Perfect Circle and Puscifer.</description>

      <description>This page presents a collection of data visualizations I’ve created, mostly for fun/in my free time. All visualizations were created using the R programming language.
#TidyTuesday Visuals#TidyTuesday is a weekly data analysis and visualization project run by the [R4DS Online Learning Community] intended to provide R users with opportunities to refine their skills. The visuals below are my contributions #TidyTuesday. Code for all visuals is in my Github.</description>
