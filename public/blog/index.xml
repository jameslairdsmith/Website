      <description>I think I first discovered Tool in middle school, when I borrowed my dad’s CDs to listen to on the bus ride to school. This was right when Lateralus came out, and I remember listening to “Schism” over and over and over, staring out of the dingy bus window every morning. Ever since then, I’ve been a huge fan – not just of Tool, but also of Maynard James Keenan’s other bands: A Perfect Circle and Puscifer.</description>
